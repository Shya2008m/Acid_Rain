    <!-- About Acid Rain -->
    <section class="card about">
      <h2 class="section-title">Acid Rain</h2>
      <p>Acid rain, also known as <strong>acid deposition</strong>, is a type of precipitation that has a high level of acids, mainly <strong>sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)</strong> and <strong>nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>)</strong>. The term "acid rain" was first used by <strong>Robert Angus Smith</strong> in 1852 while chemically investigating rainwater in the industrial areas of England and Scotland.</p>
      <p>It forms when gases like <strong>sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)</strong> and <strong>nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>)</strong> are released into the atmosphere. These gases mix with water vapor, oxygen, and other chemicals in the air to form acidic compounds, which then fall back to Earth as precipitation.</p>
      <p>Rainwater is naturally slightly acidic (pH ~5.6) because carbon dioxide dissolves in water to form weak carbonic acid. Natural sources such as volcanic gases and wildfires also contribute. Acid rain, however, has a pH of <strong>less than 5.0</strong>, often in the range of 4.0â€“4.5.</p>
      <p>The <strong>main cause</strong> of acid rain is the <strong>burning of fossil fuels</strong>. Power plants, factories, vehicles, oil refineries, metal smelting, and chemical industries release large amounts of <strong>SO<sub>2</sub></strong> and <strong>NO<sub>x</sub></strong>, which mix with rainwater to form acid rain.</p>

        <article class="effects-text">
          <p><strong>Effect on Soil:</strong> Acid rain depletes nutrients like calcium and magnesium, making soil less fertile for plant growth.</p>
          <p><strong>Effect on Plants & Forests:</strong> It damages leaves and bark, weakening trees and making them more vulnerable to disease and weather.</p>
          <p><strong>Effect on Water & Aquatic Life:</strong> Lakes and rivers become acidic, harming fish, frogs, and other aquatic animals. Fish gills are particularly affected.</p>
          <p><strong>Effect on Buildings & Monuments:</strong> Acid rain corrodes stone, metal, and paint, damaging heritage structures, especially marble monuments.</p>

    <!-- Solution -->
    <section class="card solution">
      <h2 class="section-title">Clean Energy as a Solution</h2>
      <p>The major cause of acid rain is the combustion of fossil fuels to meet energy needs. Transitioning to <strong>clean energy sources</strong> can significantly reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), which are the primary contributors to acid rain.</p>
