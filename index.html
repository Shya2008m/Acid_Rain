            <h2 class="heading2">Acid Rain</h2>
            <p>Acid rain, also known as <b>acid deposition</b>, is a type of precipitation that has a high level of acids, mainly <b>sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)</b> and <b>nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>)</b>. The term "acid rain" was first used by <b>Robert Angus Smith</b> in 1852 while chemically investigating rainwater in the industrial areas of England and Scotland.</p>  
            <p>It forms when gases like <b>sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)</b> and <b>nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>)</b> are released into the atmosphere naturally or unnaturally. These gases mix with water vapor, oxygen, and other chemicals in the air to form acidic compounds, which then fall back to Earth as precipitation.</p>  
            <p>Rainwater is slightly acidic in nature with a pH around 5.6. This is because carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) dissolves in water to form weak carbonic acid. Natural sources such as volcanic gases and wildfires also contribute. Acid rain, however, has a pH of <b>less than 5.0</b>, often in the range of 4.0â€“4.5.</p>  
            <p>The <b>main cause</b> of acid rain is the <b>burning of fossil fuels</b>. Power plants, factories, and vehicles burn fossil fuels, releasing <b>sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)</b> and <b>nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>)</b>. Industrial processes like oil refineries, metal smelting, and chemical industries also release large amounts of SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>. These gases mix with rainwater to form acid rain.</p>

                <p><b>Effect on Soil: </b>Acid rain makes the soil lose important nutrients like calcium and magnesium. This makes it harder for plants to grow healthy.</p>
                <p><b>Effect on Plants and Forests: </b>Leaves and bark of trees get damaged by acid rain. Trees become weak and more easily attacked by disease and bad weather.</p>
                <p><b>Effect on Water and Aquatic Life: </b>Lakes and rivers become acidic, which harms fish, frogs, and other animals living in water. Some fish die because their gills are damaged.</p>
                <p><b>Effect on Buildings and Monuments: </b>Acid rain slowly eats away stone, metal, and paint. Famous buildings and statues, especially those made of marble, get damaged.</p>
